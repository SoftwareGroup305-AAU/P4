In order to use the TinyCell compiler, you should open a CLI, and run the file using "./tcc <file>". This will require a input file, with the file extension in place of <file> this file, should either use the extension ".txt", or ".tc".

If you are on Linux, the file should be run using SUDO, due to some permission issues.

You will **not** be able to use the "monitor", "upload", and similar commands, that requre a board, if you are not in possession of a board that you can connect to the computer.
